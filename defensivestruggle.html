     <div id="Overview of Defense"></div>
     <p>The New York Giants defense can not close out any teams when the offense is up, and they often let the team have to play catch up. Although they are in the top 10 for allowed passing yards they are in the bottom 10 for allowed rushing yards. They play inconsistently, where as one drive they will stop the opposing offense in only three downs, but then the next they will let up a touchdown. In 2016, they had agruably one of the best defenses in the entire NFL, and coming into the 2017 season they were voted in as being the best defense in the league. They came off to a disasterous start in 2017, and it's been a complete downhill, freefall from there. It's hard to understand why this defense can not be successful because they have numerous big named stars such as Alex Ogletree, Oliver Vernon, Janoris Jenkins and Landon Collins. This defense has not looked any better this year and the continous slow, painful season continues to drag on for the New York Giants. </p>

    <p>It is not hard to stop an offense if you just follow these simple steps. The Giants though, seem to be uncapable of doing so.</p>
