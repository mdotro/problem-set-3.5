        <h3 align="center"><strong>Overview of the NY Giants 2018</strong></h3>
        <div id="Overview"></div>
        <p>
          Following a 3-13 year, the New York Giants do not look any better than they did in 2017. Many problems still pester the football club, and things are on a down side as of right now. Even with the large amount of explosive talent on the offense, the Giants find it hard to score and move the ball consistently. Along with this, the Giants defense also has a fair share of star power, but finds it hard to stop or close out teams. Although the Giants rank in the top 10 in allowing passing yards in 2018, they rank within the bottom 10 for allowed rushing yards. They, like the offense, are inconsistent and can play great one drive but abysmal the next. Giants fans all over the country have complained that their team has been just absoultly awful for the last 2 years. </p>
