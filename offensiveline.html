       <p>For many years, one lingering problem that the New York Giants have had is the complete abliteration of their offensive line. Over the last three years the New York Giants have finished within the top ten for allowed quarter back sacks, pressures and knockdowns. Even with the added talent of the star left tackle Nate Solder, the Giants can not seem to get their chemistry correct on the offensive line. There hasn't been a game in over four years where Eli Manning has not been pressured or sacked at least once.</p>

       <h5 align="center"><stong>Can Not Run the Ball</strong></h5>
         <div id="No Running Game"></div>
       <p>Another problem with not having a good offensive line is the inability to run the ball effectively. Primarily, the Giants are known as a run the ball down your throat, hard nose team. But, the Giants have lost this title over the last few years. They have not been able to run the ball effectively since 2008 where they had almost three running backs with over 1000 yards rushing.</p>
