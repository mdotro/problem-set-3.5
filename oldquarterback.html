    <div id="Too Old"></div>
   	<p>Eli Manning has been a great quarterback for the New York Giants for a long time, but he is now 37 years old. He arguably the greatest quarterback in the history of the Giants franchise, but his stats have gone down significantly in the last 3 years. He is getting too old to continue and this is becoming one of the Giants main concerns. Giants fans have loved Eli because he was the reason we have super bowls. Without him, we would probably only have two. But, over the years he has thrown some baffeling interceptions that would make you sit down and scratch your head. He has declined significantly over the last 4 years and it hurts to say that he is one of the leading reasons for the Giants destruction. </p>
